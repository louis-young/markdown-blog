# Markdown Blog

A statically generated blog website built with Next.js.

## Description

This is a Next.js application for my own personal blog. It is statically generated using Next.js and uses posts written in markdown. I have since rebuilt this project using Gatsby.

## Motivation

I built this application to allow myself to create and manage blog posts effortlessly, without having to deal with static HTML or integrating a content management system solely to manage blog posts.

## Technologies

- Next.js
- React
- Tailwind
- Prism
